->/home/john/load_test/tasmax1.nc
hsload time:  4m53s
Node: default case
      Minio had very high CPU: 18-%


Disable write chunk in hsload.py
->/home/john/load_test/tasmax2.nc
hsload time: 14.7s

Change s3_sync_interval in hsds to 10000 (from 10)
->/home/john/load_test/tasmax3.nc
hsload time: 4m46s
Note: memory usage incrased to ~1.2GB per DN node
      Minio still had fairly high CPU: 80% (not sure what was driving that)
      Not much utilization in SN/DN nodes

Replace chunk_sn write chunk with asyncio.sleep(0)
->/home/john/load_test/tasmax4.nc
hsload time: 39.4s
26 MB/s
Note: DN_4 had cpu of ~10% - repeated requests to get domain

Fix for getDomainJson: change default to False
->/home/john/load_test/tasmax5.nc
hsload time: 32.9s
Note: Low util by all DN nodes

Restore chunk write
